# DepthResNet

# Project Overview
<p>This project provides a FAST API for machine learning models including KNN, ResNet, PCA with Random Forest. Additionally, a command-line interface (CLI) is available as a pip package for local usage.</p>

# Models
<p>KNN: Classifies new data points based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors</p>
<p>ResNet: Employs a deep neural network architecture with residual connections for image feature extraction and classification.</p>
<p>PCA with Random Forest: Reduces image dimensionality using PCA, then applies Random Forest for classification</p>

## Version Dependencies
